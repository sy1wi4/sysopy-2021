after the war the war begins the war goes on
i am a soldier. look at my boots
soles worn from seeking work. from hour
in unemployment lines
call me a civilian casualty
the war to feed children the war to clothe their backs
the war to meet the rent the war to keep the gas tank full the
war to end the calculated madness keeping the poor
what happens to a war deferred
does it implode? does repressed aggression
ravage the collective soul?
(there's rioting now. i see the blaze red smoke rising.
the city burns. people are looting, taking things. all the
excess denied them. crimes of possession. to have. without
the onus of color or fear of rejection. children carry racks
of clothes. women push shopping carts brimming with food.
men flavor liquor stores and gunshops. but what we need is
revolution. bloodless or otherwise. we must go deeper than
lust gratified in one spontaneous torrid upsurge of rage)
